	/** The VertexData class manages a raw list of vertex information, allowing direct upload
	 *  to Stage3D vertex buffers. <em>You only have to work with this class if you're writing
	 *  your own rendering code (e.g. if you create custom display objects).</em>
	 *
	 *  <p>To render objects with Stage3D, you have to organize vertices and indices in so-called
	 *  vertex- and index-buffers. Vertex buffers store the coordinates of the vertices that make
	 *  up an object; index buffers reference those vertices to determine which vertices spawn
	 *  up triangles. Those buffers reside in graphics memory and can be accessed very
	 *  efficiently by the GPU.</p>
	 *
	 *  <p>Before you can move data into the buffers, you have to set it up in conventional
	 *  memory â€” that is, in a Vector or a ByteArray. Since it's quite cumbersome to manually
	 *  create and manipulate those data structures, the IndexData and VertexData classes provide
	 *  a simple way to do just that. The data is stored sequentially (one vertex or index after
	 *  the other) so that it can easily be uploaded to a buffer.</p>
	 *
	 *  <strong>Vertex Format</strong>
	 *
	 *  <p>The VertexData class requires a custom format string on initialization, or an instance
	 *  of the VertexDataFormat class. Here is an example:</p>
	 *
	 *  <listing>
	 *  vertexData = new VertexData("position:number2, color:bytes4");
	 *  vertexData.setPoint(0, "position", 320, 480);
	 *  vertexData.setColor(0, "color", 0xff00ff);</listing>
	 *
	 *  <p>This instance is set up with two attributes: "position" and "color". The keywords
	 *  after the colons depict the format and size of the data that each property uses; in this
	 *  case, we store two floats for the position (for the x- and y-coordinates) and four
	 *  bytes for the color. Please refer to the VertexDataFormat documentation for details.</p>
	 *
	 *  <p>The attribute names are then used to read and write data to the respective positions
	 *  inside a vertex. Furthermore, they come in handy when copying data from one VertexData
	 *  instance to another: attributes with equal name and data format may be transferred between
	 *  different VertexData objects, even when they contain different sets of attributes or have
	 *  a different layout.</p>
	 *
	 *  <strong>Colors</strong>
	 *
	 *  <p>Always use the format <code>bytes4</code> for color data. The color access methods
	 *  expect that format, since it's the most efficient way to store color data. Furthermore,
	 *  you should always include the string "color" (or "Color") in the name of color data;
	 *  that way, it will be recognized as such and will always have its value pre-filled with
	 *  pure white at full opacity.</p>
	 *
	 *  <strong>Premultiplied Alpha</strong>
	 *
	 *  <p>Per default, color values are stored with premultiplied alpha values, which
	 *  means that the <code>rgb</code> values were multiplied with the <code>alpha</code> values
	 *  before saving them. You can change this behavior with the <code>premultipliedAlpha</code>
	 *  property.</p>
	 *
	 *  <p>Beware: with premultiplied alpha, the alpha value always affects the resolution of
	 *  the RGB channels. A small alpha value results in a lower accuracy of the other channels,
	 *  and if the alpha value reaches zero, the color information is lost altogether.</p>
	 *
	 *  <strong>Tinting</strong>
	 *
	 *  <p>Some low-end hardware is very sensitive when it comes to fragment shader complexity.
	 *  Thus, Starling optimizes shaders for non-tinted meshes. The VertexData class keeps track
	 *  of its <code>tinted</code>-state, at least at a basic level: whenever you change color
	 *  or alpha value of a vertex to something different than white (<code>0xffffff</code>) with
	 *  full alpha (<code>1.0</code>), the <code>tinted</code> property is enabled.</p>
	 *
	 *  <p>However, that value is not entirely accurate: when you restore the color of just a
	 *  range of vertices, or copy just a subset of vertices to another instance, the property
	 *  might wrongfully indicate a tinted mesh. If that's the case, you can either call
	 *  <code>updateTinted()</code> or assign a custom value to the <code>tinted</code>-property.
	 *  </p>
	 *
	 *  @see VertexDataFormat
	 *  @see IndexData

		 *  The reason for this behavior is the peculiar way in which ByteArrays organize their
		 *  memory:
		 *
		 *  <p>The first time you set the length of a ByteArray, it will adhere to that:
		 *  a ByteArray with length 20 will take up 20 bytes (plus some overhead). When you change
		 *  it to a smaller length, it will stick to the original value, e.g. with a length of 10
		 *  it will still take up 20 bytes. However, now comes the weird part: change it to
		 *  anything above the original length, and it will allocate 4096 bytes!</p>
		 *
		 *  <p>Thus, be sure to always make a generous educated guess, depending on the planned
		 *  usage of your VertexData instances.</p>
